10. Using a Data Warehouse and How its suppose to be used - Connecting with Power BI
11. Optimizing a Data Ware house 
12. The Modern Data ware house 


Why do we need data warehouses..?? 
and Why do we use data warehouse...?

Data ware housing could be used for 2 purposes 
- Transactional data storage which is operational data keeping | OLTP - Online Transactional Processing 
- Analytical Decision Making | OLAP - Online Analytical Processing 

So if you don't have a data ware house 

- We have a lot of data but we don't know what to do with it? 
- Our sales have been declining but we are unable to organize our data as they are in different formats and locations 
- We don't have a centralized data house so our new york location gets the data refresh at least 1 day later than our San Francisco location 

Ultimately a Data Warehouse is just another database, which is optimized for 
analytical purpose. 

- Which means its going be fast and consistent 

Why do we need Data warehouses in our company? 

- To manage the operation 
- To use the data for making better decisions 
- Used for reporting and Data Analysis  

What are data ware houses: 

- Centralized and consistent location for data 
- Data must be accessible fast 
- User-friendly 
- Must load data consistently and repeatedly 

This process of extracting and transforming is known as ETL 

What is Business Intelligence? 

Business Intelligence is the building of strategies with Technologies and infrastructure which 
builds the Data Analysis 
    - Data Gathering 
    - Data Storing 
    - Reporting 
    - Data Visualization 
    - Data mining 
    - Predictive Analytics 

All these could be accomplished if we have a great data ware house! 

What is a Data Lake?

Data Lake and Data Ware house are both centralized! 

                            Data Lake                          Data Warehouse 

Data                Data is stored as a Raw Data        Data is stored as Processed data 
Technologies            Big Data                                Database 
Structure              Unstructured                            Structured 
Usage                 Not Defined Yet                    Specific is Ready to be used 
Users                 Data Scientists                       Business users and IT 


When to use what and how it is used...??? 

- Data lake is used for unstructured data coming from different resources 
- Data warehouse is used for curated data which is ready for reporting

Architecture of a Dataware house 
- Data warehouses consists of multiple layers 
- Begining of ETL 
    - Source -> Staging Layer 
    - Staging -> Transformation -> Core Layer 
    - Core Layer -> Analytics 

Data Marts : Different sub data based on requirements given to core layer, so performance and 
relevance is in synch 
Cleansing Layer : Used for cleaning the data 

The core layer is the data ware house layer. 

STAGING LAYER : 

Why do we use Staging Layer : Its to just copy the data and keep it in our environment, as working with the data on source is not possible 
Isnt Staging redundant :  We are pulling data from operational systems. 

- Short time on the source systems 
- Quickly Extracting for use 
- Moving the data safely to relational Database 
- Starting transformations from there. 

Important summary on Staging Layer 

- Staging layer is the landing Zone extracted data 
- Data in tables and on a separate database 
- As little touching as possible 
- We don't charge the source systems 
- Temporary or Persistant Staging Layers

In memory Databases : 

its a high query performance databases 
its good for analytics and high query volume 
Its usually good for relational and non-relational ways 

So how does this work? 

    - Traditionally the databases are built with discs and then they are read into memory 
    - In an in-memory database the data is present in memory itself. which means no latency in reading from database 
    - They have columnar storage, parallel query plans and other techniques 

Risks : 

If the power goes away, the information is completely loss as well this happens if db is reset 
We need to create snapshots to keep the data incase of loss so it could be loaded 
It is also very costly. 


Examples of In-Memory dbs 
- SAP HANA 
- M SQL Server In-Memory Tables 
- Oracle In-Memory 
- Amazon Memory DB 


OLAP Cubes : 

- Traditional DWH is based on RDBMS 
- Data is organized non-relational in cube (MOLAP)
- cube = Multidimensional dataset 
- cubes have data in arrays  instead of tables 
- works with many BI Solutions


Recommendation 
 - Built for a specific use-case ( as data marts in general)

ODS Layer - Also known as Operational Data Storage 
- Gets data from different sources 
- Its used for operation decision making, not analytical decision making  


ODS factors 
- No Need for long history 
- Needs to be very current or real-time 
- Once operational data storage is completed, we could go for Analytical Decisions 
Terminology is just a seasoning for Data warehousing. Ensure to adapt to context on what the functionality of 
different components is. 

Very important summary : 

Staging Layer: 

    - Landing Zone 
    - Minimal Transformation 
    - "Stage" the data in tables 

Core: 

    - Always there 
    - Business Logic and Single Point of Truth 
    - Can be sometimes the access Layer 

Mart: 

    - Access layer 
    - Specific to one use-case 
    - Optimized for Performance 

Dimensional Modeling:
---------------
- Method for organizing Data 
- In dimensional Models data could be fact or Dimension 
- Fact - Measurements 
- Dimensions - Context like category or period 

Dimensional Modeling Summary 

- Unique Technique of Structuring Data 
- Commonly used in DWH 
- Optimized for faster data retrieval
- Oriented around performance and usability 
- Designed Reporting / OLAP 

Goals of Dimensional Modeling 

- Fast Data Retrieval 
- Oriented around performance and usability 


---------------
Facts Summary: 
---------------

Facts are typically numerical values, such as 
    - sales revenue, 
    - quantity sold, 
    - profit, 
    - temperature, 
    - or any other measurable metrics 
that are relevant to the business.

Factors Affecting facts 

- Granularity 
- Measures 
- Numeric Values 
- Aggregation
- Time-Stamped 
- Foreign-keys 
- Fact Tables 
- Multi-Dimensional Models 
- Fact Types 
    here are different types of facts in data warehousing, such as 
    - additive, 
    - semi-additive, 
    - and non-additive facts, based on how they are aggregated across dimensions. 
    
    Additive facts can be 
    - directly summed up, 
    - semi-additive facts can be summed up for some dimensions (e.g., time) but not for others, 
    and non-additive facts cannot be summed up at all.

--------------------
Dimensions Summary :
--------------------
 Dimensions are used to slice, dice, and filter data, 
 allowing users to analyze the facts from different perspectives. 
 They bring structure to the data and help users answer specific 
 questions about the business.

- Usually Non-Aggegatable 
- Characters are descriptive in nature 
- Dimensions are mostly stable and do not vary as fact tables 
- Dimensions are present in dimensional tables 

Attributes of dimensional table 

- Descriptive Attributes 
- Hierarchial Attributes 
- Categorical Data 
- Textual Data 
- Slowly Changing Dimensions 
- Dimension Tables 
- Role of Dimensions in Multidimensional models 
- Dimensional modelling

STAR SCHEMA 
-----------

Star Schema is a widely used data modeling technique in data warehousing. 
It is designed to optimize the querying and analysis of data for business 
intelligence and reporting purposes. In a Star Schema, data is organized 
into a central fact table and multiple dimension tables, creating a star-like 
structure. This design simplifies data retrieval and enables efficient querying 
and aggregation of information.

Key components of a Star Schema:

Fact Table: 

The fact table is the centerpiece of the Star Schema. 
It contains the quantitative and numerical data (facts) 
that represent business events or transactions. 
Examples of facts could be sales revenue, quantity sold, profit, etc. 
The fact table typically includes foreign keys that relate to the primary
keys of dimension tables.

Dimension Tables: 

Dimension tables surround the fact table and provide descriptive
attributes and context for the facts. Each dimension table represents 
a specific category or perspective, such as Time, Product, Customer, 
Location, etc. The dimension tables contain the descriptive attributes
 related to each dimension, and they serve as entry points for data 
 analysis along various dimensions.

Foreign Keys: 

The fact table contains foreign keys that link to the primary keys of
dimension tables. These foreign keys establish the relationships between 
the facts and dimensions, allowing data analysts to combine information 
from different tables when querying the database.

Advantages of Star Schema:

Simplified Queries: 

Star Schema simplifies querying because data is denormalized, 
reducing the number of joins required to retrieve data. This leads 
to faster query performance and better response times for analytical queries.

Enhanced Performance: 

The structure of Star Schema allows for efficient indexing and caching, 
leading to improved query performance. As a result, data retrieval is faster, 
making the data warehouse more responsive to user requests.

Easy to Understand: 

Star Schema's simple and intuitive design makes it easier for data analysts 
and business users to understand and work with the data. Analyzing data 
along different dimensions becomes straightforward, leading to more 
effective decision-making.

Flexibility: 

The Star Schema design is flexible and adaptable to changing business 
requirements. Adding or modifying dimensions and facts is relatively 
straightforward, making it easier to accommodate new business needs.

Wide Industry Adoption: 

Star Schema is a well-established and widely adopted data modeling 
technique in data warehousing. Many business intelligence tools and 
technologies are optimized for working with Star Schema-based data warehouses.

While Star Schema offers significant advantages, it may not be the most 
suitable design for all scenarios. It is most effective when dealing with 
simple and straightforward analytical queries. In more complex scenarios, 
other data modeling techniques like Snowflake Schema or Galaxy Schema might 
be considered to better meet specific requirements.

Summary 

- Most commonly used schema 
- Simplest form 
- Work best for specific needs
